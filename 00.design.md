#### [对比LevelDB多了哪些?](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Features-Not-in-LevelDB)
- Performance
  - Multithread compaction
  - Multithread memtable inserts
  - Reduced DB mutex holding
  - Optimized level-based compaction style and universal compaction style
  - Prefix bloom filter
  - Memtable bloom filter
  - Single bloom filter covering the whole SST file
  - Write lock optimization
  - Improved Iter::Prev() performance
  - Fewer comparator calls during SkipList searches
  - Allocate memtable memory using huge page.
- Features
  - Column Families
  - Transactions and WriteBatchWithIndex
  - Backup and Checkpoints
  - Merge Operators
  - Compaction Filters
  - RocksDB Java
  - Manual Compactions Run in Parallel with Automatic Compactions
  - Persistent Cache
  - Bulk loading
  - Forward Iterators/ Tailing iterator
  - Single delete
  - Delete files in range
  - Pin iterator key/value
  - Alternative Data Structures And Formats
  - Plain Table format for memory-only use cases
  - Vector-based and hash-based memtable format
  - Clock-based cache (coming soon)
  - Pluggable information log
  - Annotate transaction log write with blob (for replication)
- Tunability
  - Rate limiting
  - Tunable Slowdown and Stop threshold
  - Option to keep all files open
  - Option to keep all index and bloom filter blocks in block cache
  - Multiple WAL recovery modes
  - Fadvise hints for readahead and to avoid caching in OS page cache
  - Option to pin indexes and bloom filters of L0 files in memory
  - More Compression Types: zlib, lz4, zstd
  - Compression Dictionary
  - Checksum Type: xxhash
  - Different level size multiplier and compression type for each level.
- Manageability
  - Statistics
  - Thread-local profiling
  - More commands in command-line tools
  - User-defined table properties
  - Event listeners
  - More DB Properties
  - Dynamic option changes
  - Get options from a string or map
  - Persistent options to option files
